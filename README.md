## Pyroteus Goal-Oriented Mesh Adaptation Toolkit

Pyroteus provides metric-based goal-oriented mesh
adaptation functionality to the Python-based finite
element library [Firedrake][firedrake]. The 'y' is
silent, so its pronunciation is identical to 'Proteus'
- the ancient Greek god of the constantly changing
surface of the sea.

This is research of the Applied Modelling and
Computation Group ([AMCG][amcg]) at Imperial College
London.
