Pyroteus used to provide metric-based goal-oriented mesh adaptation functionality to the Python-based 
[Firedrake finite element library](https://firedrakeproject.org). It has since been split into two packages:
[Animate](https://github.com/pyroteus/animate) and [Goalie](https://github.com/pyroteus/goalie). The documentation
for Animate and Goalie is hosted at https://pyroteus.github.io.
