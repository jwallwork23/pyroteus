Pyroteus Goal-Oriented Mesh Adaptation Toolkit
==============================================

Pyroteus provides metric-based goal-oriented mesh adaptation
functionality to the Python-based finite element library
`Firedrake <http://www.firedrakeproject.org/>`__. The 'y' is
silent, so its pronunciation is identical to 'Proteus' - the
ancient Greek god of the constantly changing surface of the
sea.
