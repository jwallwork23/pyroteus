"""
Problem specification for a version of
the DG advection test case which treats
the solution as three separate tracer
fields.

See
    ./solid_body_rotation.py

for details on the problem itself.

The test case is notable for Pyroteus
because: (a) the model is comprised of a
system of equations which are solved
sequentially; and (b) more than one
linear solve is required per field per
timestep.
